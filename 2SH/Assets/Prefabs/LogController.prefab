  textToShow: "Hi there! Welcome to the world of Hacking! My name is Snowden Junior!
    People call me the hacking Guru! For some, Hacking is brain sport! Others use
    it for attacks, Myself \u2026 I recruit hackers as profession. Any good hacker
    must know how to get past a simple login system. Don\u2019t try and guess the
    password on your own. Let Comtron do that for you.  Think of it as a simple console
    where you can type commands. Since this is a simple login system, just type in
    'watk' and then a name of a filename. Make sure the file exists. If you're not
    sure, type 'showfiles'. Once you have the data extracted, type 'see' and then
    the name of the file you want to see the content of. Then, just use the bottom
    right corner console to type in the right credentials."
